## Description

I went to the [The Hepworth Wakefield](https://hepworthwakefield.org/) recently and saw 
_Leaving (With Two-Minute Silence)_ as part of the "Anthony McCall: Solid Light Works" exhibition (16 Feb - 3 June 2018). I thought it would be interesting to try to re-create the effect using JavaScript and THREE.js.

## Hints

* [Anthony McCall - Lecture: "Recent Work and Current Projects"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvuqdpsmS-s)
    * 21:00 - 26:50

Bits of descrption garnered from the above video:    

* double horizontal work
* clock wipe
* the image gets brought in in this circular manner
* the idea of a form that begins as a complete cone of light, but through the agency of a wedge, is gradually cut into until there is nothing left at the end of a, say, 30 minute period
* the idea of the clock wipe working in coordination with the expanding wedge
* a circle, a straight line and then a travelling wave, forming one single line
* as the wedge expands into the form, the whole form is itself rotating so you get a kind of a twisting action through space and through time
* two cones of light - they move in opposite directions
* left is going from everything to nothing while the right hand one is going from nothing to everything and they are both going through this twisting motion

## TODO

* [ ] Create basic project structure
* [ ] Add simple ellipse
* [ ] Add basic animation of the ellipse
* [ ] Add simple "clock-hand"
* [ ] Add basic animation of the "clock-hand"
* [ ] Try to re-create the exact movement of the form
* [ ] Add the opposite form
* [ ] Try to re-create the haze/cone/membrane effect
* [ ] Deploy to gh-pages branch
